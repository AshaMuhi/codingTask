## K-means Clustering Task

**File:** `Kmeans_task-checkpoint.ipynb`

### Description
This task involves applying K-means clustering on a dataset to identify patterns and groupings. The process includes data preprocessing, visualization, normalization, and cluster analysis. Learning K-means clustering is essential for understanding how to segment data into meaningful clusters, which is a fundamental technique in unsupervised machine learning.

### Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Dropped non-numeric columns from the dataset.
2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Plotted nine different scatter plots with various combinations of variables against GDPP.
   - Identified the most promising plots for clustering.
3. **Normalization:**
   - Normalized the dataset using `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn`.
4. **Optimal Clusters:**
   - Used the elbow method and silhouette score to find the optimal number of clusters.
5. **Model Fitting:**
   - Fitted the scaled dataset to the optimal number of clusters.
   - Reported the silhouette score of the model.
6. **Cluster Visualization:**
   - Visualized clusters for `Child mortality vs GDP` and `Inflation vs GDP`.
   - Labeled groups of countries based on child mortality, GDPP, and inflation as least developed, developing, and developed, or ranked them accordingly.

## Neural Network Task

**File:** `neural_network-checkpoint.ipynb`

### Description
This task focuses on implementing and understanding neural networks, particularly for logical gate simulations. It includes building neurons for NOR, AND, and NAND gates, and constructing an XOR gate using a neural network. Understanding neural networks is crucial for developing complex models that can learn and make predictions from data.

### Steps Performed
1. **NOR Gate Truth Table and Neuron Model:**
   - Provided a truth table and modeled a NOR gate using neurons.
2. **Combining Logical Gates:**
   - Combined AND, NOR, and NAND gates using a neural network.
   - Provided example code for defining the Neuron class and generating truth tables.
3. **Constructing an XOR Gate:**
   - Implemented an XOR gate using a neural network.
   - Included weights, biases, neuron layers, and training with backpropagation.
4. **Feedback and Correction:**
   - Addressed feedback on syntax errors and undefined variables.
   - Corrected and completed the XOR gate neural network implementation.

## Sentiment Analysis Task

**File:** `sentiment_anylysis-checkpoint.py`

### Description
This task involves developing a sentiment analysis model using the spaCy library to analyze product reviews. The process includes text preprocessing, model implementation, and testing. Learning sentiment analysis is vital for understanding natural language processing (NLP) and its applications in analyzing textual data.

### Steps Performed
1. **Model Implementation:**
   - Loaded the `en_core_web_sm` spaCy model for NLP tasks.
2. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Removed stop words and performed text cleaning.
   - Selected the `review.text` column and removed missing values.
3. **Sentiment Analysis Function:**
   - Defined a function to predict sentiment from product reviews.
4. **Model Testing:**
   - Tested the sentiment analysis function on sample product reviews.
5. **Additional Analysis:**
   - Compared similarity between two product reviews using spaCy's features.
   - Included informative comments to clarify code rationale.
